# MTPE-Effort-Estimator
An estimation of the effort required by a linguist to perform the post-editing task.

Why focus on this subject? For years I have been working as a Project Manager in the Translation field and had many difficulties calculating a fair price for an MTPE project, for both, the client and the linguist.

#The purpose of this project is to get a log file including an analysis of the source text word count split among different categories depending on the quality of the provided MT for each word. We will do so by getting a percentage number for each Translation Unit (TU) and then, assigning this percentage to all the words included in that TU. After that, we will classify all words into different categories. For example: 0-50% ----- Bad quality: Better to start from scratch 50-74% ----- It can be post-edited 75-84% ----- It can be post-edited 85-94% ----- It can be post-edited 95-99% ----- Only minor corrections needed 100% ----- Perfect Translation (No modifications needed)
